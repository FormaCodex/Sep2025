In HTML, paragraphs are defined with the p tag.<br>
A paragraph element in an HTML document is made up of content <br>
such as text, images or other content<br>
which appears between an opening p tag and closing p tag.
</font>
</p>

<font face=Times New Roman size=2 color=aqua>
The p tag is the HTML tag for a paragraph. Adding the p tag to an HTML document, <br>
followed by text, will create a paragraph on your page.<br>
Adding the closing p tag will end the paragraph.<br>

<h1> These breaks, that use "[br]" empty tags, break a line, like how in a word processor, hitting "enter" will break the line if it hasn't continued off the end and automatically broken. I will now demonstrate it with some Gundam Quotes and brs.</h1>
