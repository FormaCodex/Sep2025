<h1> An Introduction of Paragraph Tag</h1>

<p>
In HTML, paragraphs are defined with the p tag.<br>
A paragraph element in an HTML document is made up of content <br>
such as text, images or other content<br>
which appears between an opening p tag and closing p tag.
</p>
<br>

<hr size=10 width=500 align=left noshade color=red>
<h1>Behold! A Horizontal Line!!! (This is done with a [hr] tag, and this is e5, where a [hr size =10 width=500 align=left noshade color=red] tag is used)</h1>
<br>

<p> The p tag is the HTML tag for a paragraph. Adding the p tag to an HTML document,<br>
 followed by text, will create a paragraph on your page.<br>
 Adding the closing p tag will end the paragraph.<br>
</p>
<h1> These breaks, that use "[br]" empty tags, break a line, like how in a word processor, hitting "enter" will break the line if it hasn't continued off the end and automatically broken. I will now demonstrate it with some Gundam Quotes and brs.</h1>
