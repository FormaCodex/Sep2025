<h1> About Side 7 School of Computing </h1>
<hr>
<h2>Side 7, a cluster of colonies newly constructed midway through the One Year War, S7SC saw a brief inaugral year before war broke out when Zeon attacked, but Amuro Ray, in the Legendary Gundam, fought off the Zakus, although in the battle, caused one to explode, ripping open a hole in the colony wall. Almost 2 decades after the One Year War, S7SC is the go-to educational institution for earthnoids and spacenoids alike, where all can learn the fundamentals of the world around them.<br> <br> <br> With a political climate as intense and overpowering as the EFF's current rule over space, S7SC is the ideal safe haven for folks of all walks of life to thrive and survive together. </h2>
